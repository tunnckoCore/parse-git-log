## API

### [parseGitLog](index.js#L48)

> Parses an advanced `git log` output using
streams. Allows custom `plugin` function to be passed
to update/modify the commit object (which is [vfile][]).
It also emits `data` and `commit` events, so you may not
need such `plugin` function. But in case you want to do some
more parsing and interesting stuff, this `plugin` function
allows you to do cool things. That `plugin` function is called
with "transform stream" context and this is also passed as
first argument. When you return a function from that plugin,
it is called with [vfile][] object (commit object) as first argument.

**Params**

* `[cwd]` **{String}**: path to where is the `.git` folder; defaults to `process.cwd()`    
* `[plugin]` **{Function}**: smart plugin function, passed with `stream, file` signature, if returns another function, that function is passed with `file` object which represent each commit object.    
* `returns` **{Stream}**: transform stream, using [through2][] behind

## Contributing
Pull requests and stars are always welcome. For bugs and feature requests, [please create an issue](https://github.com/tunnckoCore/parse-git-log/issues/new).  
Please read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for advice on opening issues, pull requests, and coding standards.  
If you need some help and can spent some cash, feel free to [contact me at CodeMentor.io](https://www.codementor.io/tunnckocore?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=tunnckocore&utm_campaign=github) too.

**In short:** If you want to contribute to that project, please follow these things

1. Please DO NOT edit [README.md](README.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and [.verb.md](.verb.md) files. See ["Building docs"](#building-docs) section.
2. Ensure anything is okey by installing the dependencies and run the tests. See ["Running tests"](#running-tests) section.
3. Always use `npm run commit` to commit changes instead of `git commit`, because it is interactive and user-friendly. It uses [commitizen][] behind the scenes, which follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.
4. Do NOT bump the version in package.json. For that we use `npm run release`, which is [standard-version][] and follows Conventional Changelog idealogy.

Thanks a lot! :)

## Building docs
Documentation and that readme is generated using [verb-generate-readme][], which is a [verb][] generator, so you need to install both of them and then run `verb` command like that

```
$ npm install verbose/verb#dev verb-generate-readme --global && verb
```

_Please don't edit the README directly. Any changes to the readme must be made in [.verb.md](.verb.md)._

## Running tests
Clone repository and run the following in that cloned directory

```
$ npm install && npm test
```
